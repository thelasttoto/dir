# Agent Directory

The Agent Directory (dir) allows publication of information about AI agents via standard data models. 
It provides standard interfaces to perform publication, 
discovery based on queries about agent's attributes and constraints, 
and storage for the data models with basic security features such as provenance and ownership.

## Features

- **Standards**: Defines a standard models for agent data representation.
- **Extensions**: Supports model and build extensions to enrich models with usage-specific data.
- **Announce**: Enables publication of new agents on the network.
- **Discover**: Allows listening for the publication of new agents on the network.
- **Search**: Supports searching of agents across the network that satisfy given attributes and constraints.
- **Security**: Employs common standards to provide data provenance and ownership.

## Source tree

Main software components:

- [api](./api) - gRPC specification for models and services
- [cli](./cli) - tooling for interacting with services
- [e2e](./e2e) - end-to-end testing framework
- [registry](./registry) - distributed services for storage and publication of agents

## Requirements

- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)
