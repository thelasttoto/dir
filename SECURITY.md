## Report a security issue

The DIR project team welcomes security reports and is committed to
providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be
reported privately via [security@agntcy.org](mailto:security@agntcy.org).
Security issues should not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.


## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The
project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect
users of DIR, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

Downstream project maintainers and DIR users can request participation in
coordination of applicable security issues by sending your contact email address,
GitHub username(s) and any other salient information to [security@agntcy.org](mailto:security@agntcy.org).
Participation in security issue coordination processes is at the discretion of the DIR team.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. The DIR team announces security issues via [project GitHub Release notes](https://github.com/agtncy/dir/releases).
